Given the root of a binary tree, return the length of the diameter of the tree.

The diameter of a binary tree is the length of the longest path between any two nodes in a tree. This path may or may not pass through the root.

The length of a path between two nodes is represented by the number of edges between them.


Code:
    int diameterOfBinaryTree(TreeNode* root) {
        int d=0; 
        diameterDFS(root, d);
        return d-1;
    }
    
    int diameterDFS(TreeNode* root, int& d){
        
        if(root == NULL)
            return 0; 
        int lh = diameterDFS(root->left, d); 
        int rh = diameterDFS(root->right, d);
        d = max(d, lh+rh+1); 
        return max(lh,rh) + 1; 
    }
